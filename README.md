# SortingProgram
Different Run-Time for  Sorting Algorithms from CLRS(Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein) tested.

This Program is a GUI program written in Java, to compare run-time of popular and well-know algorithms.

To Start program:
  1. Click on "Generate File"(It generates a number of random doubles and saves them to file.txt*).
  2. Click on "Read File".
  3. Choose any of the sorting algorithms to see their run-time.

*If you wish to sort your own file you should save it as "file.txt"
